# VBA-challenge

Create a script that loops through all the stocks for each quarter and outputs the following information:

The ticker symbol

Quarterly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

The percentage change from the opening price at the beginning of a given quarter to the closing price at the end of that quarter.

The total stock volume of the stock. The result should match the following image:

*Not included

Add functionality to your script to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % decrease", and "Greatest total volume". The solution should match the following image:

*Not included

Make the appropriate adjustments to your VBA script to enable it to run on every worksheet (that is, every quarter) at once.

note:
Make sure to use conditional formatting that will highlight positive change in green and negative change in red.

Other Considerations
Use the sheet alphabetical_testing.xlsx while developing your code. This dataset is smaller and will allow you to test faster. Your code should run on this file in just a few seconds.

Make sure that the script acts the same on every sheet. The joy of VBA is that it takes the tediousness out of repetitive tasks with the click of a button.
