Reset Button- Andrew Lane provided this code in a study group we had with several classmates over the weekend and I added it after I had completed the assignment as it was very helpful to reset using a macro versus manually deleting the results

Greatest% Increase/Greatest Decrease- I researched how to write a code that would look up the maximum and minimum values. Initially, I struggled with the formula for calculating the greatest total volume and reached out to Andrew for advice, assuming the issue was related to the min/max formula and worked on that for awhile which you can see in my code the various attemps i was making with the max code for the volume. However, it turned out that the problem was with how I was resetting the volume for the total stock volume calculation. I had originally placed the volume = 0 reset after the loop, but while adjusting things to test different outputs, I mistakenly moved it before the loop without realizing how this affected the results. I didnâ€™t notice the incorrect output until much later.

Message Box- Since the code takes some time to run, I added a message box at the end to display a notification when the code has finished running.
